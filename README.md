## Introduction

I work in public health and I am a software engineer. There is a COVID-19 vaccine available from 3 different brands (Pfizer, Moderna, and most recently Johnson&Johnson). In Georgia, the vaccine is available to all residents regardless of citizenship or documentation status. Unfortunately, many noncitizens, documented and undocumented, don't know they are allowed to get the vaccine. Additionally, some vaccine sites turn people away if they don't have ID. In Georgia, the only documentation required is proof of residence, which can be proven through a utility bill or some form of mail. This mobile app will allow noncitizens to report their experiences at vaccine sites not only to hold vaccine sites accountable for discrimination but also help other immigrants go to vaccine sites that are safer and more convenient for them.
